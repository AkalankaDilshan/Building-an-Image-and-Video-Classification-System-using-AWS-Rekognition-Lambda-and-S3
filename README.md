# Building-an-Image-and-Video-Classification-System-using-AWS-Rekognition-Lambda-and-S3

This project aims to build a scalable image and video classification system using AWS Rekognition, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3. The system is designed to automatically detect and classify objects (e.g., "Dog") in images and videos uploaded to an S3 bucket. The project leverages AWS Rekognition's machine learning capabilities to analyze media files and generate JSON responses containing detected labels.
